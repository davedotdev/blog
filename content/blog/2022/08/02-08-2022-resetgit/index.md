That's right, another week, another creation called [resetgit.com](https://resetgit.com). This one inspired by my constant reGoogling of resetting `git` repositories. 

Google has broken humanity and we're constantly Googling our way through life. Not one to break humanities downfall, I decided to add to the search results. Next time you break `git` and search for help, you just might find this.

### Building Sharpens The Skill

I've fell in love with UI and UX and whilst I'm way off from building custom components without JSX or HTML to rely on, I can feel my understanding blossoming and my outputs slowly improving. Building `ResetGit.com` flexed some new skills and I discovered a new library called Code-Blocks along the way which is pretty cool.

[ResetGit.com](https://resetgit.com) is built with:

- React
- Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [React Code-Blocks](https://github.com/rajinwonderland/react-code-blocks)
- [React Bootstrap Alert](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts/)
- [Alliance1](https://www.myfonts.com/products/1-light-alliance-458502) Font from MyFonts

The Alliance1 font is just gorgeous and figured it would be lovely as the header font.

### Wrap

In somewhat of a twisted version of the 100 days of code, every week I try and build something lightweight to learn something new or deepen a previous lesson. ResetGit.com was this week's thing and you never know, it might be useful on your travels. It took no more than a couple of hours to build and I spent more time messing around generating the header and favourite icons than the code itself. Enjoy!
