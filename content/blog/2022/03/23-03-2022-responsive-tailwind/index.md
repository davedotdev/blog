[TailwindCSS](TODO) is really popular and recently the same team released [TailwindUI elements](TODO). There is also [Tailwind Elements](https://tailwind-elements.com/) which have MDB styling (I now use both).

As the web is increasingly mobile first, it's important that any site and widget is responsive. That means the app or web page looks coherent and usable whether on a small mobile, tablet, laptop, or PC screen. You'll notice responsive pages when you change the size of the browser on a laptop or desktop machine, as elements dynamically move as the page re-arranges for the screen size.

I ran into a tiny challenge when noticing odd footer behaviour at 320px width and below on a single page application and figured it was time to make it properly responsive.

#### Mobile First & Responsive Design

Making a page responsive to the viewers display device is important, because as generations get younger, viewing a site is done increasingly so on mobile devices like smart phones and tablets. In fact, some statistics show millennials and younger expelling some six hours a day of screen time. Yikes.

Anyhow, none of this is new and media queries became a [W3C](https://www.w3.org/standards/history/css3-mediaqueries) recommended standard in June 2012. These media queries are key to [responsive web design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) which is also tied to the mobile first movement started by [Luke Wroblewski](https://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp).

If you've done anything with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/#overview-mobile), then you'll probably be familiar with these concepts.

A nice way to visualise this is content is like water!

#### TailwindCSS

In TailwindCSS I had a tiny challenge in so much I wanted a footer to be spread over two lines and centred when the media breakpoint was small (`sm`) and over one line when the media breakpoint was medium (`md`). I had to play with the tags a little, but here's what worked.

The top element is hidden on all breakpoints at `sm`. The bottom element is hidden until `sm`. Simple right? It's a flip-flop type affair with the change happening on the same media breakpoint.

```html
<div class="bg-gray-300 hidden sm:flex">
  <h1>only md</h1>
</div>
<div class="bg-gray-400 sm:hidden sm:flex">
  <h1>only sm</h1>
</div>
```

Below is a screen shot of the TailwindCSS playground. You can click on the image, and it will take you to the playground gist.
