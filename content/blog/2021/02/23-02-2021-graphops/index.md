This page contains information I've been gathering in the name of an emerging branch of operations I'm dubbing "GraphOps". This isn't staring at XY scatter plots, but dealing with infrastructure as a richly connected graph of resources that either consume or provide services to and from users. They are *alive*, not quite like Johnny 5, but in the sense of continually reflecting state and relationships.

Imagine a world where an unexpected issue triggers the generation of a blast radius linked tree, highlighting outcomes, failures and steps taken to recover. With a rich tapestry like a graph representation of your infrastructure, you have a foundation for self-driving and self-healing systems. It becomes possible to make a change and verify or validate the outcome and even provides percepts for machine-learning and artificial intelligence.

I've been lucky that different groups have humoured me with mad ramblings. I'm firmly of the belief the way forward for operations is in this manner.

Imagine knowing the what, where, why and how for your infrastructure and service delivering resources - always.

## Inspiration

*   Promise Theory
    *   Read Mark Burgess and Jan A.Bergstra's book.

*   Cellular Automata

*   Labelled Transition Systems

*   Matroid Theory

*   Harlan. D.Mills - Software Productivity

*   Edsger W.Dijkstra - A Discipline of Programming

*   John Ousterhout - A Philosophy of Software Design

*   Fred Brooks - No Silver Bullet

*   Rachel Traylor's education on Graph Theory and Reliability (see IPSpace offerings)
    *   A fantastic mathematician and available for work (if you didn't know that!). She's software savvy and opened me up to levels of depths I didn't know existed.

*   Simon Wardley - Wardley Mapping

*   Terminator Salvation 
    *   Glimpsed into the imagination of someone thinking about SkyNet. What I saw when the film hit the cinema excited me. Here are some screen shots.
