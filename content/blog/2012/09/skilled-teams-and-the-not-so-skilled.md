It would be so nice for everyone you work with to be reading from the same piece of paper, including management and the people who hold the purse strings. The [Dunning Kruger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) symptoms are discovered far too frequently, but like any American conspiracy movie (Shooter?), work is a huge game of politics, glory hunting and second guessing. When you work with a good team, you protect it, love it and don’t really ever want to move. You’ll take the pay cuts, extra overtime and burning comments from those at home to retain your happy every day activity which ultimately pays the bills and puts food in your mouth. For the times when you don’t work in that team, below are some nice one liners to keep yourself entertained with.

There are so many of these floating around, but the above represent some of my favorite. Also, many of these could leave you without a job so probably not a good idea to *actually* use them.
