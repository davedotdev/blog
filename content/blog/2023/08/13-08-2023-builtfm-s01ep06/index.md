I first made contact with Ivan a long time ago over VxLAN and a math mistake that I found in a Cisco paper. Roll the clock forward a bit and I became a co-host on his Software Gone Wild podcast and so, figured it was time to dive into his back story in episode 6! Ivan has had a colourful career so prepare for some laughs!
