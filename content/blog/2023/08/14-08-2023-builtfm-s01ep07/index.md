{{<blogheader>}}S01EP07 Let's talk developer education with Mat Ryer and Bill Kennedy from the land of Golang!{{</blogheader>}}

{{<imgpodcast href="" src="s01ep07.png" alt="S01EP07">}}<br/>

Learning technology that will be valuable for your career can be hard. Finding out about the tech is one problem, then finding solid information to digest it is another great hurdle to jump. Mat Ryer & Bill Kennedy join me for episode 7 to discuss developer education and (lots) more. We talk a lot about the Go community, because this pair are super heroes from that space, but the lessons are widely applicable.

At epiosde 7, I also started doing video, so you now have the choice of both!

## Mat Ryer

Has been writing Go since before v1. He is a host on @GoTimeFM. He co-created Testify, and it's minimalist younger brother [http://github.com/matryer/is](http://github.com/matryer/is), and xbar: a macOS app that lets you put the output of any script into the menu bar. Currently building IRM tools at Grafana Labs. He also runs an online monthly choose your own adventure comedy show @MarkWatsonCo on Twitter. He wrote this bio himself, in the third person, which feels disingenuous so that's why I, I mean he, has fessed up now.
