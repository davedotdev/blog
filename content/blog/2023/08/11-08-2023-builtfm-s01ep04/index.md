{{<blogheader>}}Season one, episode 4, we chat startup marketing with one of the most interesting people I've ever had the privilege of speaking with, Ana Bibikova!{{</blogheader>}}

Episode 04 took a different turn from the previous episodes and we embraced the dark side and went down the marketing path! Ana Bibikova wrote a Notion marketing playbook, which I found fascinating and she was active in some of my social media circles, so being terrified of marketing people, I said hello and got talking. She also offered a "roasting" service, in which your beloved baby of a product could get destroyed by Ana, in the name of improving it. What's not to love? Luckily, she treated me gently and we recorded this episode! Ana's background is absolutely fascinating and I'm lucky to chat through her story.

You can find out more about Ana below. Since we recorded this, Ana transitioned to Aimondo where she's the head of marketing.
