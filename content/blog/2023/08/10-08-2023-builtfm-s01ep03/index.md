Rafal Wilinski is the man behind Dynobase, a desktop tool for the AWS DynamoDB database. After reading a book on Dynamo, Rafal's tool was mentioned, I tried it, loved it and had to chat! DynamoDB made sense for many of the things I do and Dynobase became a staple tool in my day to day. We introduce Rafal, what drove him down the path of creating a tool and chat what it's like being a creator.
