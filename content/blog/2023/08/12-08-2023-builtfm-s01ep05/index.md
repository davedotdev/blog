{{<blogheader>}}S01EP05 I chat with Dagobert Renouf about Logology, Memeology and upsetting his father in law.{{</blogheader>}}

{{<imgpodcast href="" src="s01ep05.png" alt="S01EP05 with Dago Renouf">}}<br/>

With little time, so much can change. When I first met Dagobert, he was working on a startup called Logology with his wife Lucy. Roll the clock forwards a good few months (almost eight I think), and Logology is no more, but the legend that is Dago and Lucy's story will live on in the community.

EP05 is now a look back in time as I chat Logology with Mr Dagobert Renouf.

April 2024 Update: Dago has since moved on from Logology and is concentrating on content generation!
