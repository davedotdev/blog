Giorgi reached out to be in early 2022 and I liked the cut of his jib. He'd identified a use case for one of his projects with one of my blog posts. Whilst I didn't purchase, I was impressed with his approach and attitude, so we had to chat!

Hunker down and listen to Season 01 Episode 02 of Built.
