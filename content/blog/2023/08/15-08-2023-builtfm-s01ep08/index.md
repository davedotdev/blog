{{<blogheader>}}S01EP08 I chat with Mac Martine, who is a personification of determination and grit. He did something few do and went straight to sales and figured out how to work with them. Amazing.{{</blogheader>}}

Mac is life long entrepreneur and passionate SaaS bootstrapper. Heâ€™s also the person behind [thesaasbootstrapper.co](http://thesaasbootstrapper.co/?ref=built.fm) which makes him a source of inspiration and truth! I had the privilege of being joined by Mac for episode 08 and was left with energy to grind and hustle. His approach is straight forward, no-nonsense and with a lack of tech religion, which was refreshing. Mac is also open to other builders reaching out to him and a huge supporter of indie hacking and entrepreneurial activities.
