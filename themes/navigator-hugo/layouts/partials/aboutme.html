                Hi there. My name is David Gee. I'm a product leader, software & electronics engineer, blogger, software developer, international speaker and a technologist, residing in England, UK. You can read more
                about my background on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/davedotdev">LinkedIn.</a> I have been fortunate enough to enjoy a varied career and have spent over two decades in communications, computer networking and software, at an advanced level, working for manufacturers of computer networking equipment, open source software vendors and have spent a large chunk of my career in highly connected distributed systems and automation.

                <h4>Products and Projects</h4>
                <div>
                    In my spare time, I participate in the communication industry, providing computer networking (indoor and outdoor, wired and wireless), distributed
                    systems engineering, and I write software like Micro-SaaS systems. My current projects include
                    <a href="https://clientrecordcards.com">ClientRecordCards</a>, a simple CRM system for the Hair and Beauty industry,
                    <a href="https://dumperoo.com">Dumperoo</a>, a free tool for capturing and inspecting webhooks and HTTP requests,
                    <a href="https://viralheadline.net">ViralHeadline</a>, a tool for creating attention-grabbing headlines for social media, and
                    <a href="https://curvium.com">Curvium</a>, providing expert network consultancy specializing in Arista solutions.
                    I also support local councils and government with their computer networking, air quality and anti-social behaviour monitoring because I believe in improving the area that my family and friends live.

                        I charge for software or engineering work and ensure that I charge fair prices, pay my taxes and pay suppliers promptly. As such, I'm a member of the <a href="https://goodbusinesscharter.com/">Good Business Charter</a>, a worthwhile organisation that promotes ethics in business, setup by Julian Rich, the very same person who setup Richer Sounds!
