                Hi there. My name is David Gee. I'm a product leader, software & electronics engineer, blogger, software developer, international speaker and a technologist, residing in England, UK. You can read more
                about my background on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/davedotdev">LinkedIn.</a> I have been fortunate enough to enjoy a varied career and have spent over two decades in communications, computer networking and software, at an advanced level.

                <h4>Products and Projects</h4>
                <div>
                    I operate in the UK in my spare time in the communication space (computer networking), distributed
                    systems engineering and I write software, mainly things like Micro-SaaS systems. One of my curret
                    projects (2024) is <a href="https://clientrecordcards.com">ClientRecordCards</a>, which is a CRM
                    system for the Hair and Beauty industry. I also support local councils and government with the
                    computer networking, CCTV and security systems, because I believe in making the area better that I
                    and my family live.

                    <h4>Ethics and Business</h4>
                    <div class="pb-20">
                        I charge for software or engineering work and ensure that I charge fair prices, pay my taxes and pay suppliers promptly. As such, I'm a member of the <a href="https://goodbusinesscharter.com/">Good Business Chater</a>, a worthwhile organisation that promotes ethics in business, setup by Julian Rich, the very same person who setup Richer Sounds!
